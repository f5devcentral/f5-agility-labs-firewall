Base BIG-IQ Configuration
-------------------------

In this lab, the VE has been configured with the basic system settings
and the VLAN/self-IP configurations required for the BIG-IQ to
communicate and pass traffic on the network. Additionally, the Data
Collection Device has already been added to BIG-IQ and the BIG-IPâ€™s have
been imported and have been gathering health statistics. They have not
however had their configurations imported.
