Base BIG-IP Configuration
-------------------------

In this lab, the VE has been configured with the basic system settings
and the VLAN/self-IP configurations required for the BIG-IP to
communicate and pass traffic on the network. We will now need to
configure the BIG-IP to listen for traffic and pass it to the back-end
server.

1.  Launch the Chrome shortcut titled “BIG-IP UI” on the desktop of your
    lab jump server. For this lab you will be working on
    bigip1.dnstest.lab (http://192.168.1.100). The credentials for the
    BIG-IP are conveniently displayed in the login banner. Just in case:
    **admin / 401elliottW!**

2.  Navigate to **Local Traffic** > **Nodes** and create a new node with
    the following settings, leaving unspecified fields at their default
    value:

    - Name: lab-server-10.10.0.50
    - | Address: 10.10.0.50
      | |image51|

3.  Click **Finished** to add the new node.

4.  Navigate to **Local Traffic** > **Pools** and create a new pool with
    the following settings, leaving unspecified attributes at their
    default value:

    - Name: lab-server-pool
    - Health Monitors: gateway_icmp
    - New Members: Node List
       - Address: lab-server-10.10.0.50
       - Service Port: \* (All Services)
       - | Click **Add** to add the new member to the member list.
         | |image52|

5.  Click **Finished** to create the new pool.

6.  Because the attack server will be sending a huge amount of traffic,
    we’ll need a large SNAT pool. Navigate to **Local Traffic** >
    **Address Translation** > **SNAT Pool List** and create a new SNAT
    pool with the following attributes:

    - Name: inside_snat_pool
    - | Member List (click Add after each IP):
      | 10.10.0.125, 10.10.0.126, 10.10.0.127, 10.10.0.128, 10.10.0.129, 10.10.0.130
    - | Click Finished
      | |image53|

7.  Navigate to **Local Traffic** > **Virtual Servers** and create a new
    virtual server with the following settings, leaving unspecified
    fields at their default value:

    - Name: udp_dns_VS
    - Destination Address/Mask: 10.20.0.10
    - Service Port: 53 (other)
    - Protocol: UDP
    - Source Address Translation: SNAT
    - SNAT Pool: inside_snat_pool
    - Default Pool: lab-server-pool

8.  | Click Finished
    | |image54|
    
9.  We’ll now test the new DNS virtual server. SSH into the attack host
    by clicking the “Attack Host (Ubuntu)” icon on the jump host desktop.
    
10. | Issue the ``dig @10.20.0.10 www.example.com +short`` command on the BASH CLI of the attack host.  You should see output similar to:
    | |image55|
    | This verifies that DNS traffic is passing through the BIG-IP.

11. Return to the BIG-IP and navigate to **Local Traffic** > **Virtual Servers** and create a new virtual server with the following settings, leaving unspecified fields at their default value:

    - Name: other_protocols_VS
    - Destination Address/Mask: 10.20.0.10
    - Service Port: \* (All Ports)
    - Protocol: \* All Protocols
    - Any IP Profile: ipother
    - Source Address Translation: SNAT
    - SNAT Pool: inside_snat_pool
    - Default Pool: lab-server-pool

12. | Click Finished
    | |image56|

13. Return to the Attack Host SSH session and attempt to SSH to the
    server using SSH 10.20.0.10. Simply verify that you are prompted for
    credentials and press CTRL+C to cancel the session. This verifies
    that non-DNS traffic is now flowing through the BIG-IP.
