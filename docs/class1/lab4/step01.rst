Lab Overview
============

Day 3, you get a little curious and wonder why both BIG-IP’s you’ve been
working on say they’re managed by BIG-IQ (look near the red f5 ball on
the top left of both BIG-IP’s). Unbelievable, all this time you’ve been
configuring both devices independently when you could have been
configuring them on a central management device.

Central Management Version - 6.0 was a major evolution of the BIG-IQ
product line designed to become the primary source of centralized
management for all physical and virtual F5 BIG-IP devices. BIG-IQ
extends its offerings for security users, improving the user experience,
and adding robustness and scale throughout the platform.
