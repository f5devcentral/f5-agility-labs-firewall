Filtering specific DNS operations
---------------------------------

The BIG-IP offers the ability to filter DNS query types and header
opcodes to act as a DNS firewall. To demonstrate, we will block MX
queries from our DNS server.

1.  Open the SSH session to the Attack Host.

2.  | Perform an MX record lookup by issuing the following command:
    | ``dig @10.20.0.10 MX example.com``

3.  The server doesn’t have a record for this domain. This server
    doesn’t have MX records, so those requests should be filtered

4.  Navigate to **Security** > **Protocol Security** > **Security
    Profiles** > **DNS** and create a new DNS security profile with the
    following values, leaving unspecified attributes at their default
    value:

    - Name: dns-block-mx-query
    - | Query Type Filter: move mx from Available to Active and click finished
      | |image74|

5.  Navigate to **Local Traffic** > **Profiles** > **Services** >
    **DNS**. **NOTE:** if you are mousing over the services, DNS may not
    show up on the list. Select **Services** and then use the pulldown
    menu on services to select **DNS**.

6.  Create a new DNS services profile with the following values, leaving
    unspecified values at their default values:
    
    - Name: dns-block-mx
    - DNS Traffic
       -  DNS Security: Enabled
       - | DNS Security Profile Name: dns-block-mx-query. Click finished
         | |image75|

7.  Navigate to **Local Traffic** > **Virtual Servers** > **Virtual
    Server List**.

8.  Click on the **udp_dns_VS** virtual server name.

9.  In the **Configuration** section, change the view to **Advanced**.

10. | Set the **DNS Profile** to **dns-block-mx**.

11. Click **Update** to save your settings.

12. Navigate to **Security** > **Event Logs** > **Logging Profiles**.

13. Click on the **dns-dos-profile-logging** logging profile name.

14. Check **Enabled** next to **Protocol Security**.

15. | In the **Protocol Security** tab, set the **DNS Security
      Publisher** to **local-db-publisher** and check all five of the
      request log types.

16. Make sure that you click **Update** to save your settings.

17. | Return to the Attack Server SSH session and re-issue the MX query
      command:
    | ``dig @10.20.0.10 MX example.com``

18. The query hangs as the BIG-IP is blocking the MX lookup.

19. | Navigate to **Security** > **Event Logs** > **Protocol** >
      **DNS**. Observe the MX query drops.

This concludes the DNS portion of the lab. On the Victim Server, stop
the top utility by pressing **CTRL + C**. No mail for you Joanna!!
