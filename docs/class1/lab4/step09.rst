Workflow 2: Interacting with the data in the dashboards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  | You can narrow the scope of what is graphed by selecting a object
     or objects from the selection panels on the right. For example, if
     you only want to see data from BIG-IP01, you can click on it to
     filter the data.

-  You can create complex filters by making additional selections in
   other panels

-  | You can zoom in on a time, by selecting a section of a graph or
     moving the slider at the top of the page
   | |image105|
   | or
   | |image106|

-  All the graphs update to the selected time.

-  | You can change how far in the data you want to look back by using
     the selection in the upper left (note you may need to let some time
     elapse before this option becomes available)
