Module 1 â€“ Detecting and Preventing DNS DoS Attacks on a Virtual Server
=======================================================================

In this section of the lab, we'll configure the steps necessary to ensure that the BIG-IP 
can  forward traffic to the back-end server that is hosting our DNS service. We will then 
attack the  resources behind the virtual server, mitigate the attack, and finally review 
the reports and logs generated by the BIG-IP.
