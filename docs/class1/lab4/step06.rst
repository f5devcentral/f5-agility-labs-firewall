Workflow 2: Uploading QKviews to iHealth for a support case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BIG-IQ can now push qkviews from managed devices to ihealth.f5.com and
provide a link to the report of heuristic hits based on the qkview.
These qkview uploads can be performed ad-hoc or as part of a F5 support
case. If a support case is specified in the upload job, the qkview(s)
will automatically be associated/linked to the support case. In addition
to the link to the report, the qkview data is accessible at
ihealth.f5.com to take advantage of other iHealth features like the
upgrade advisor.

1. Navigate to **Monitoring** **Reports** **Device** **iHealth

you’ll need for support to engage quicker.
