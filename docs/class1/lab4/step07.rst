Workflow 3: Device Import
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BIG-IQ is capable of centrally managing multiple products, for this lab
we will only manage LTM and AFM. To import the device configurations,
follow the steps below

1. Navigate to the Devices tab and click on **BIG-IP Devices** (left
   panel)

   remedy this simply click on the “Complete Import Tasks” Link

3. First Re-discover the LTM service

4. Then Discover the AFM service

5. Once Re-discovery has completed, import both the LTM and AFM services

6. Repeat this same procedure for both devices, once completed your
   screen will show the following.
