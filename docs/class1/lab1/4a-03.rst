Create and View Log Entries
---------------------------

In this section, you will generate various types of traffic through the
firewall as you did previously, but now you will view the log entries
using the network firewall log. Open your web browser and once again try
to access http://10.30.0.50. Also, try to ping 10.30.0.50.

Open the **Security > Event Logs > Network > Firewall** page on
bigip2.dnstest.lab (192.168.1.150). The log file shows the ping requests
are being accepted and the web traffic is being dropped:

Although we will not configure external logging in this lab, you should
be aware that the BIG-IP supports high speed external logging in various
formats including **SevOne**, **Splunk** and **ArcSight**.
