About Postman â€“ REST Client
===========================

Postman helps you be more efficient while working with APIs. Postman is
a scratch-your-own-itch project. The need for it arose while one of the
developers was creating an API for his project. After looking around for
a number of tools, nothing felt just right. The primary features added
initially were a history of sent requests and collections. You can find
Postman here - `www.getpostman.com <http://www.getpostman.com>`__.
