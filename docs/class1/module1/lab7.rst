Lab 7: Configure a Clone Pool for SSL Visibility to IDS Sensors or Other Security Tools
=======================================================================================

SSL encrypted traffic poses a problem for many security devices. The performance of those 
devices is significantly reduced when trying to decrypt SSL traffic. Since the BIG-IP 
is designed to efficiently handle SSL traffic using specialized hardware and optimized software 
libraries, it is in the unique position to 'hand-off' a copy of the decrypted traffic 
to other devices.

In this solution, since the BIG-IP is terminating SSL, traffic is forwarded to the secondary virtual server in clear-text so that an unencrypted copy of the application traffic is sent to an external sensor such as an IDS for further security assessment.

1. Return to the BIG-IP TMUI in Chrome and inspect the preconfigured IDS_Pool.

2. Navigate to **Local Traffic** > **Pools** > **Pool List**.

3. Select the *IDS_Pool*, then click on the **Members** tab.

   .. Note:: Unencrypted traffic will be forwarded to this IP address.

4. Attach the *IDS\_Pool* as a clone pool to the server side of the external virtual server by navigating to 
   **Local Traffic** > **Virtual Servers** > **Virtual Server List** and clicking on *EXT\_VIP\_10_1_10_30*.

5. Select **Advanced** from the pulldown at the top of the Configuration section to view advanced configuration options.

6. Scroll to the configuration for Clone Pool (Client) and select **None**. For the Clone Pool (Server), select **IDS_pool**.

   .. Note:: Leave all other fields using the default values.

8. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click **Update**.

9. Select the Putty application from the desktop on the jump host.

10. Load **Lamp Server** from the sessions list.

11. Click **Open**. Accept the certificate warning, if presented. You should be automatically logged in as the F5 user with certificate authentication.

12. Input the TCPDUMP command to start capturing traffic:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo tcpdump -n -i eth1 -c 200 port 8081

13. Initiate another attempt to connect to the website via curl using the Cygwin application on the desktop. It 
    may be helpful to position the windows on the desktop side-by-side so that you can see both the Putty session 
    and the Cygwin session.

.. code-block:: console

   curl -k https://10.1.10.30:8081 -H 'Host:site1.com' -H 'X-Forwarded-For: 172.16.99.5'

   curl -k https://10.1.10.30:8081 -H 'Host:site3.com' -H 'X-Forwarded-For: 172.16.99.5'

Initiate another attempt to connect to the websites using the browser. These sites should be loaded in tabs 3 
and 5, but notice that we're using a different destination port.

.. code-block:: console

   https://site2.com:8081

   https://site4.com:8081

View the tcpdump output on the syslog-webserver.
