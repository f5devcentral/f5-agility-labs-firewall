Module 3: F5 Dynamic Firewall Rules With iRules LX
==================================================

This lab introduces iRules Language eXtensions (LX) or iRulesLX which enables node.js on the BIG-IP platform. The lab uses Tcl iRules and JavaScript code to make a MySQL call to look up a client IP address providing access control in the Multi-Layered Firewall.

This could be useful in developer driven / devops environments where the development team can modify firewall policies simply by updating a database.

.. WARNING:: IP addresses in screenshots are examples only. Please read the
   step-by-step lab instructions to ensure that you use the correct IP
   addresses.
