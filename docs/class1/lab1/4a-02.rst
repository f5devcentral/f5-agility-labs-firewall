Rule Hierarchy
--------------

With the BIG-IP\ :sup:`Â®` Network Firewall, you use a context to
configure the level of specificity of a firewall rule or policy. For
example, you might make a global context rule to block ICMP ping
messages, and you might make a virtual server context rule to allow only
a specific network to access an application.

Context is processed in this order:

-  Global

-  Route domain

-  Virtual server / self IP

-  Management port\*

-  Global drop\*

The firewall processes policies and rules in order, progressing from the
global context, to the route domain context, and then to either the
virtual server or self IP context. Management port rules are processed
separately, and are not processed after previous rules. Rules can be
viewed in one list, and viewed and reorganized separately within each
context. You can enforce a firewall policy on any context except the
management port. You can also stage a firewall policy in any context
except management.

.. TIP:: You cannot configure or change the Global Drop context. The Global Drop context is the final context for traffic. Note that even though it is a global context, it is not processed first, like the main global context, but last. If a packet matches no rule in any previous context, the Global Drop rule drops the traffic.
