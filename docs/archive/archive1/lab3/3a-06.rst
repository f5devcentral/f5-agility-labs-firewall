Single Endpoint Flood
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The single endpoint flood attack is an attempt for an attacker to send a
flood of traffic to a host in hopes of overwhelming a service to a point
of failure. In this example, we’ll flood the target server with ICMP
packets.

1.  In the BIG-IP web UI, navigate to **Security** > **DoS Protection**
    > **Device Configuration** > **Network Security**.

2.  Expand the **Single-Endpoint** category in the vectors list.

3.  Click on **Single Endpoint Flood** vector name.

4.  Configure the vector with the following parameters:

    - State: Mitigate
    - Threshold Mode: Fully Manual
    - Detection Threshold EPS: 150
    - Mitigation Threshold EPS: 200
    - Add Destination Address to Category: Checked
    - Category Name: denial_of_service
    - Sustained Attack Detection Time: 10 seconds
    - Category Duration Time: 60 seconds
    - | Packet Type: Move Any ICMP (IPv4) to Selected

5.  Click **Update** to save your changes.

6.  Open the BIG-IP SSH session and scroll the ltm log in real time with
    the following command: ``tail -f /var/log/ltm``

7.  We’ll run a packet capture on the victim server to gauge the
    incoming traffic. On the victim server, issue the following command:
    ``sudo tcpdump -nn not port 22``

8.  | On the attack host, launch the attack by issuing the following
      command on the BASH prompt:
    | ``sudo hping3 10.20.0.10 --faster -c 25000 --icmp``

9.  The attack host will begin flooding the victim server with ICMP
    packets. However, you will notice that the traffic to the server
    stops after a short time (10 seconds, the configured sustained
    attack detection time.)

10. After approximately 60 seconds, run the attack again. ICMP traffic
    will return to the host. This is because the IP Intelligence
    categorization of the attack host has expired.

11. Return to the BIG-IP web UI.

12. Navigate to **Security** > **Event Logs** > **DoS** > **Network** >
    **Events**. Observe the log entries showing the details surrounding
    the attack detection and mitigation.

13. Navigate to **Security** > **Event Logs** > **Network** > **IP
    Intelligence**. Observe the log entries showing the mitigation of
    the sweep attack via the ip-intelligence policy.

14. Navigate to **Security** > **Reporting** > **Network** > **IP
    Intelligence**. Observe the statistics showing the sweep attack and
    mitigation.

15. Navigate to **Security** > **Reporting** > **DoS** > **Dashboard**
    to view an overview of the DoS attacks and timeline. You can select
    filters in the filter pane to highlight the specific attack.

16. Finally, navigate to **Security** > **Reporting** > **DoS** >
    **Analysis**. View detailed statistics around the attack.

This concludes the DoS/DDoS portion of the lab. You have successfully
defeated Joanna, she has decided a career at Chotchkie’s is more
prosperous than nefarious internet activities, even with the new flair
requirements. Well done!
