Test Access to the Server
-------------------------

-  Open a new Web browser and access http://10.30.0.50

Good to, wait, **not go**. What happened? I added a rule, why didn’t this
work? 

Let’s look at the logs again (**Security > Event Logs > Network >
Firewall).** They basically look the same as before, lets look at the
ordering of the rule we just created (**Security > Network Firewall >
Active Rules change contex to route domain 0).** Take note the newly
created rule has a counter value of 0, if we look at the order we can
see the reject rule, which we added in the web_rule_list has incremented
and appears to be matching the traffic before it reaches our new rule.
**(Be sure to expand the Rule List to see the counts)** Let’s modify the
rule order slightly to accomplish what we’re looking for. From within
the Active Rules section simply drag the application_rule_list **ABOVE**
the web_rule_list. Don’t forget to commit the changes.

The new ordering should look something like the screen shot below:
