Stale Rule Report
=================

AFM also can list out stale rules within the device its self. You must
first enable the feature. To enable, navigate to **Security >Reporting >
Settings > Report Settings.** You will then need to check
“\ **Collect Stale Rules Statistics**\ ” found under the Network
Firewall Rules Section. Please be sure to click “Save” before
proceeding.

Once enabled, navigate to **Security >Reporting > Network > Stale
Rules.** Feel free to refresh the web page we’ve been testing with
(http://10.1.20.11) to see data populate into the rules.

.. NOTE:: It could take 60+ seconds for data to populate

This information is quite useful for keeping a rule base tidy and
optimized.

**Anyone can create a firewall rule, but who is the person that removes the unneccesary ones?**
