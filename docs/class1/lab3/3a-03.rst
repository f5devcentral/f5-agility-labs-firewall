Simulating a TCP SYN DDoS Attack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the last example, Joanna crafted a packet that is easily identified
as malicious, as its invalid. Weâ€™ll now simulate an attack with traffic
that could be normal, acceptable traffic. The TCP SYN flood attack will
attempt to DDoS a host by sending valid TCP traffic to a host from
multiple source hosts.

1.  In the BIG-IP web UI, go to **Security** > **DoS Protection** >
    **Device** **Configuration** > **Network Security**.

2.  Expand the **Flood** category in the vectors list.

3.  Click on **TCP Syn Flood** vector name.

4.  Configure the vector with the following parameters:
    
    - State: Mitigate
    - Threshold Mode: Fully Manual
    - Detection Threshold EPS: 200
    - Detection Threshold Percent: 500
    - | Mitigation Threshold EPS: 400

5.  Click **Update** to save your changes.

6.  Open the BIG-IP SSH session and scroll the ltm log in real time with
    the following command: ``tail -f /var/log/ltm``

7.  | On the attack host, launch the attack by issuing the following
      command on the BASH prompt:
    | ``sudo hping3 10.20.0.10 --flood --rand-source --destport 80 --syn -d 120 -w 64``

8.  After about 60 seconds, stop the flood attack by pressing **CTRL +
    C**.

9.  Return to the BIG-IP web UI and navigate to **Security** > **Event
    Logs** > **DoS** > **Network** > **Events**. Observe the log entries
    showing the details surrounding the attack detection and mitigation.

10. Navigate to **Security** > **Reporting** > **DoS** > **Dashboard**
    to view an overview of the DoS attacks and timeline. You can select
    filters in the filter pane to highlight the specific attack.

11. Finally, navigate to **Security** > **Reporting** > **DoS** >
    **Analysis**. View detailed statistics around the attack.
